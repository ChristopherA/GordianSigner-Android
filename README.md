**Gordian Cosigner** allows users to participate in a multisig by adding a signature to an otherwise unsigned or partially signed PSBT, where they did not initiate the transaction. It can also be used for signing a single-signature PSBT. It's largely intended as an offline signing tool, which allows signing without the usage of a full node: a real wallet is need to both initiate an account map and to initiate a transaction.

## Additional Information

This is a companion app for the Gordian system:

* [Gordian system](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Gordian) — A self-sovereign Bitcoin wallet and node

**GordianCosigner** is a multiplatform utility that's also available as:

* [GordianCosigner for iOS](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/GordianSigner-Catalyst)
* [GordianCosigner for MacOS](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/GordianSigner-macOS)

Some of Cosigner's functioanlity has been superceded by the newer Gordian SeedTool app:

* [Gordian SeedTool](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/GordianSeedTool-iOS) — An app for storing seeds and for signing PSBTs with those seeds

However, they both remain useful reference apps for demonstrating the use of Gordian Principles and Blockchain Commons specifications, and Cosigner is currently the only Android-compatible app.

## Gordian Principles

**Gordian Cosigner** is a reference implementation meant to display the [Gordian Principles](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Gordian#gordian-principles), which are philosophical and technical underpinnings to Blockchain Commons' Gordian technology. This includes:

* **Independence.** Cosigner allows you to sign PSBTs in a way you see fit.
* **Privacy.** Cosigner keeps your signing totally offline.
* **Resilience.** Cosigner also keeps your seeds offline, just communicating signatures through airgaps.
* **Openness.** Cosigner communicates through airgaps via URs and QRs, for maximum interoperability.

Blockchain Commons apps do not phone home and do not run ads. Some are available through various app stores; all are available in our code repositories for your usage.

## Status - Late Alpha

**GordianCosigner-Android** is currently under active development and in the late alpha testing phase. It should not be used for production tasks until it has had further testing and auditing.
